# week-2-hw

PROJECT
Draft of a Personal Portfolio webite with Bio on the landing page, and links to a page that displays projects I have made (currnetly placeholders) as well as a page with a contact form. 

PHP File
I am having trouble getting the PHP file to execute.  Clicking the SEND button on the contact page links to the mail.php file, but the code on that file will not run, it just goes to a page that lists the code.  I have been reading about PHP and I understand some browsers do not support it?  Does Chrome not support it ... that might be my problem.

ERRORS - index.html
There are two errors on the Index HTML file that appear in the W3 Validator when ran.  I could not find a solution to these two errors.  (They are listed below).

1. Error: Stray start tag div.

From line 65, column 7; to line 65, column 29

-->↩      <div class="container">↩     

2. Error: The aria-controls attribute must point to an element in the same document.

From line 19, column 7; to line 19, column 178

/a>↩      <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">↩     

ERRORS - portfolio.html
There are two errors on the Portfolio HTML file that appear in the W3 Validator when ran.  The first error can be ignored and I could not find a solution to the second error.  (They are listed below).

1. Warning: This document appears to be Lorem ipsum text but the html start tag has lang="en". Consider using lang="zxx" (or variant) instead.

From line 1, column 16; to line 2, column 16

type html>↩<html lang="en">↩  <he

2. Error: The aria-controls attribute must point to an element in the same document.

From line 20, column 7; to line 20, column 178

/a>↩      <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">↩
