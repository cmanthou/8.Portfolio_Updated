              <p>Cory was born and raised in Seattle, WA.  After a short stint working for an investment firm post-college, Cory moved on to hold various roles in Operations and Manufacturing for several Contemporary and Luxury Lifestyle Brands.  Through this work, he had the opportunity to live/work in a variety of cities around the country and around the world.  He has lived and worked in Seattle, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, New York, New Orleans and now currently resides in the Greater Philadelphia Area (Radnor, PA).  
                Cory is married to Cara Ludwig and they welcomed thier first child, a daughter named Marigny in August of 2019.  She is named for a neighborhood in New Orleans that holds a special place in Cory and Cara's hearts.  
              </p>
              <p>Cory is a Founding Partner and current COO of Fulcrum TS, a consulting firm based in New York that works with growing start-up companies in the Fashion and Fashion Tech industries to organize themselves from an operations standpoint, expand thier manufacturing vendorbase and secure capital to scale.</p>
              <p>Throughout his career Cory has had the pleasure of working with both front-end and back-end devlopers and always wanted to learn their craft.  He feels not only will coding add an extra layer of value to his current career, but it will also be a good skillset to have when his daughter is old enough learn it as well.</p>
